  <h3>What the heck am I looking at?</h3>

  <p>This is the quantum version of a ball on a spring. Stick an ordinary ball on a spring and give it a tug, and it will bounce back and forth. Same with a quantum ball (like an electron)!

  <p>The purple U shape represents the potential, the red horizontal line is the level(s) of energy, and the yellow rotating thing is the wavefunction.
    
  <p>The wavefunction is <i>kinked</i> because there <i>are no solutions</i> to the Schrödinger equation for that energy. Try to find an energy that eliminates the kink!

  <h3>What is the Schrödinger Equation?</h3>

  <p>Quantum mechanics is a theory of Nature at the scale of individual particles, like electrons. Such particles cannot easily be described like a marble, with a position and a speed. Instead we describe them with something called a <i>wavefunction</i>, from which position and speed can be derived. The Schrödinger equation describes how the wavefunction of a system evolves over time.</p>

  <p>In Newtonian mechanics, you are given some configuration of positions, velocities,
  masses, and forces, and by solving F=ma, you can determine the system's state at some
  future time.</p>

  <p>In quantum mechanics, forces are instead described by a potential. By plugging that
  potential into the Schrödinger equation, you compute the wavefunction
  &#968; (or more precisely, a set of allowed wavefunctions). The wavefunction, in turn,
  tells you what result you would actually measure - or their probabilities!</p>

  <h3>What is a potential?</h3>

  <p>A potential is a function that tells you how much potential energy you would have at
  each position.</p>

  <p>Imagine a hill. When you ride a bike up the hill, you have to expend effort to lift
  yourself up, and your potential energy increases. At the top of the hill, your
  potential energy is maximized. Now, coast down the hill: your potential energy
  decreases as it is transferred to kinetic energy. Reach the bottom of the valley, and
  your potential energy is minimized. If you were to plot your potential energy according
  to your position, the graph would look like the hill itself! This function we just
  graphed, of energy according to position, is called the potential.</p>

  <p>Now think about a spring attached to a wall. When you pull the spring away from the
  wall, it stretches and pulls back (Hooke's Law!) We can put the distance you pull the
  spring on the X axis, and the energy you need to impart on the Y axis. This is also a
  potential, and its graph will be a parabola.</p>

  <p>Potentials arise often in quantum mechanics. For example, the nucleus of a hydrogen
  atom establishes a potential that affects the electron. We can calculate this potential
  simply, using Coulomb's Law. We then plug that potential into the
  Schrödinger equation and solve it; this establishes the wavefunction of the
  electron, from which we can predict all sorts of neat things, like the colors of light
  that hydrogen emits!</p>

  <h3>What is a wavefunction?</h3>

  <p>A wavefunction represents the state of a system, such as an electron. It is
  literally a function, whose inputs are time and position, and whose output is a complex
  number. When written this way, physicists use the Greek letter psi: &#968;(x,t)</p>

  <p>It is also possible to express the wavefunction as a function of time and
  <i>momentum</i>. Here physicists use the Greek letter phi: &#966;(p,t). Other
  coordinate systems are possible but these two (position and momentum) are the most
  common.</p>

  <p>You do more than just plug time and space into the wavefunction! You plug the
  wavefunction itself into all sorts of integrals, from which you determine many
  dynamical properties: position, velocity, kinetic energy, momentum, and so on. You also
  do <i>algebra</i> on wavefunctions: add them to each other, multiply them by scalars,
  and so on. Eventually the wavefunction takes on a life of its own, not merely a
  function but a value in its own right.</p>

  <p>If you know some linear algebra, this notion of adding and multiplying by scalars
  may remind you of vectors. Indeed, you can think of the wavefunction as a vector, who
  lives in a type of vector space called Hilbert space.</p>

  <p>The output of the wavefunction &#968; is a complex number. If you take the absolute
  value of that complex number, and you square it, it gives you the probability of
  finding the particle at that point. (Recall that the absolute value of a complex number
  is a <i>real</i> number).</p>

  <p>At this point, you may wonder why we don't just take the squared absolute value of
  the wavefunction itself, call <i>that</i> the wavefunction, and avoid this annoying
  complex number two-step? Read on!</p>

  <h3>Properties of wavefunctions</h3>

  <p>It's not very hard to be a wavefunction. You have to satisfy the
  Schrödinger equation, and moreover you have to be <i>localized</i>: as we
  move further away in space, you have to get closer and closer to zero. Otherwise, you
  get nutty, non-physical results like probabilities that sum to more than 1.</p>

  <p>The Schrödinger equation is <i>linear</i>. This means that if you have
  two wavefunctions, you can add them together and get a new wavefunction, and it also
  satisfies the Schrödinger equation. If you've heard of superposition, that's
  what that is. The visualizer allows you to create superpositions (click the +
  button).</p>

  <p>Linearity also means you can multiply a wavefunction by whatever constant you want,
  like 7, and it still satisfies the Schrödinger equation. You can even
  multiply it by a complex number, like 3 + 5i. When you do this, <i>nothing happens</i>:
  all wavefunctions that are (complex) multiples of one other represent the same physical
  state! (Except zero!) This will be a very useful property in our numerical
  technique.</p>

  <h3>Wavefunctions as Vectors</h3>

  <p>Recall that wavefunctions are functions, but it's also natural to treat them as
  vectors in a vector space. If you know some linear algebra, you may remember that
  vector spaces have a basis - in fact, many of them. A basis is like the cardinal
  directions, from which all directions can be given ("Northeast by east"). All
  wavefunctions are a superposition of the basis wavefunctions! This helps us understand
  an arbitrary wavefunction by decomposing it into its basis wavefunctions, which may be
  simpler.</p>

  <p>Of course, you can come up with a different basis, and it will be just as valid. A
  superposition isn't inherent, it is just an artifact of which coordinate system you
  choose to describe the wavefunction.</p>

  <h3>The Energy Basis</h3>

  <p>One especially interesting coordinate system is called the energy basis. It is
  called the energy basis because it is the eigenbasis of the energy operator. The
  "cardinal directions" of our energy basis are wavefunctions of definite energy. These
  wavefunctions have a very simple time dependence: their absolute value at every point
  doesn't change!</p>

  <p>This visualizer allows you to build wavefunctions by adding up the energy basis
  components.</p>

  <h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>These exercises are designed to be done with only the
  visualizer and your brain.

  <ol>
    <li class="headish">
      <h4>Stationary States</h4>
    </li>
    <li value="1">
      Use the "V" button to load the Simple Harmonic Oscillator
      potential, with just the single energy bar (the horizontal red line with the
      slider). Pause the simulation by clicking the play (triangle) button. Move the
      energy bar up and down to try to find an energy that eliminates the "kink" in
      the wavefunction (on its right side).
    </li>

    <li>What is the <i>smallest</i> energy that eliminates the kink in the wavefunction?

      <p>Notice the gap between this energy and the bottom of the potential! This is the
      <i>ground state energy</i>. In a classical world, you can go all the way down to
      the minimum: your ball can rest at the bottom of the bowl. Not so in a quantum
      world! Your quantum state must have some kinetic energy.</p>
    </li>

    <li>What other energies eliminate the kink in the wavefunction? Can you find a
    formula for them?
    
      <p>The set of allowed energies is <i>quantized</i>. This means that if
      you want your system to have a definite energy, you can't pick any old energy. You
      must select from the allowed list of eigenenergies.</p>

      <p>Does this mean that the system can only have these energies? We can build a
      system whose energy expectation value is anything we please, as long as we stay
      above the ground state. However, these systems are necessarily a <i>mixture</i> of
      states with the quantized energies. If we measure their energy, we will only ever
      see one of the quantized values.</p>
    </li>

    <li>In the ground state, is the particle more likely to be found in the center or near the edges?
        How about for the next-smallest energy? To answer these questions, turn on <i>|&#968;|<sup>2</sup></i>. Its graph shows you where the particle is most likely to be found.

      <p>A classical harmonic oscillator ("ball-on-a-spring") spends most of its time at the edges.</p>
    </li>


    <li class="headish"><h4>Tunnelling</h4></li>

    <li value="5">Locate the two points where the energy bar crosses the potential. (The thin gray
    lines help you here). These are the <i>classical turning points</i>. A classical
    particle cannot reach outside of the turning points, because its kinetic energy would
    be negative. But a quantum particle may be found in the classically forbidden region.
    This is <i>quantum tunnelling</i>.</li>

    <li>Display <i>|&#968;|<sup>2</sup></i>. Locate the classically forbidden region.
    Does the wavefunction tunnel into this region?</li>

    <li>Try some other potentials. Which potential has no tunnelling? Why not?</li>

    <li>Load the Two Square Wells potential. Try to find the energy that maximizes the
    amount of tunnelling into the potential barrier (the "wall" in the middle).
    </li>

    <li class="headish"><h4>Time Evolution</h4></li>

    <li value="9">Ensure the Play button &#9654; is clicked, and enjoy the show. The z-axis (depth)
    represents the imaginary component of the wavefunction.</li>

    <li>Does more energy make the wavefunction rotate faster or slower?</li>

    <li>Display <i>|&#968;|<sup>2</sup></i>. Why doesn't it move?</li>

    <li>Add another energy by clicking the + button. Why does <i>|&#968;|<sup>2</sup></i> move now?

      <p>States with definite energy change their complex phase, but not their complex
      magnitude (at a given point in space). Informally, the wavefunction doesn't shrink
      or grow in time, it just goes around.</p>

      <p>But once you have two states, their phases <i>interfere</i>. When you add two
      complex numbers, the resulting magnitude may be bigger (constructive interference)
      or smaller (destructive interference) than the original magnitudes, depending on
      the phase.</p>

      <p>And if those states have different energies, their phase goes around at
      different speeds. This means the type of interference at each point changes in
      time. Now it is constructive; a moment later it is destructive.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="headish"><h4>Momentum</h4></li>

    <li value="13">Load the Infinite Square Well solution and start at the ground state. Show the
    momentum magnitude |&#966;|<sup>2</sup>. What does the momentum distribution look
    like?

      <p>A momentum spike in the middle means that the particle is most likely to be
      found with zero momentum. This is the "rest in the bottom of the bowl" state.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Now move the energy bar up. What happens to the momentum?

      <p>A spike to the left or right means the particle is likely to be found moving
      left or right respectively. The further away the spike is from the center, the
      faster the particle is moving.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Does more energy make the particle move faster or slower?

      <p>Note this is separate from the rate of oscillation. You answer this by looking
      at the <i>distribution</i> of the momentum-space wavefunction, not how it moves.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Load an asymmetric potential, such as the stepped square well, with a single
    energy. Notice that the position space wavefunction is asymmetric. Is the momentum
    space wavefunction asymmetric too? Why or why not?</li>

    <li>A classical particle in a 1D potential well will "bounce:" roll up one side, then
    the other. Its momentum thus oscillates left, right, left... Can you make our quantum
    momentum oscillate? (Hint: you can't do it with just one energy!)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="numerical_method">The Numerical Method</h2>

  <p>The Schrödinger equation is a second order differential equation. This
  visualizer numerically solves the Schrödinger equation using the <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerov%27s_method">Numerov method</a>, which is fast
  and accurate. It is a "step" method, meaning that it constructs each point by building
  on the previous point(s). However, there are a few wrinkles.</p>

  <p>The starting point of this work is <a href=
  "http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~giannozz/Corsi/MQ/LectureNotes/mq.pdf">Numerical Methods
  in Quantum Mechanics</a>, by Paolo Giannozzi.</p>

  <h3>Blow-up solutions</h3>

  <p>One problem is that solutions to the Schrödinger equations "want" to blow
  up to infinity. In physical systems, the particle should be localized to some region
  (like the lab!), which means the wavefunction of a bound particle must approach zero as
  you get further away. Only a few solutions to the Schrödinger equation
  localize the particle in this way, and those solutions only exist for very precise
  energies. Numerically we are much more likely to "find" a solution that approaches
  infinity.</p>

  <p>To prevent this (following Giannozzi), we construct TWO wavefunctions. The "inside
  out" one starts from inside the potential and steps towards the edge. This solution is
  well behaved in the center, but probably blows up towards the edge. The "outside in"
  solution assumes the wavefunction is zero at the boundary, and steps towards the
  center. This solution does not blow up, but it often decays to zero towards the
  center.</p>

  <p>Once we have these two solutions, we join them into a single wavefunction. Towards
  the center, this will be our "inside out" wavefunction, and towards the end it will be
  the "outside in." Unless we are very lucky, they will not have the same value at the
  point they meet - but we can force them to! This leverages linearity: the remarkable
  fact that scaling a wavefunction by any complex number produces the same physical
  result; thus given two wavefunctions, we can always join them at a point by just
  scaling the first to match the second, at that point (unless it's zero!)</p>

  <h3>Kinks</h3>

  <p>Note that while we can always make our "inside out" and "outside in" wavefunctions
  agree at the turning points, we cannot force their derivatives to agree. Thus our
  chimera wavefunction does not actually solve the Schrödinger equation at
  that point, since the first derivative is not defined! This is a manifestation of the
  fact that there are <i>no</i> solutions of the Schrödinger equation at the
  chosen energy, except for the unphysical blow-ups.</p>

  <p>At what point should we join them? The natural choice is the "classical turning
  points:" the (outermost) point where the potential equals the energy, i.e. our particle
  has zero kinetic energy. Understanding why this point is natural requires understanding
  a bit of the Schrödinger equation.</p>

  <h3>Modes of the Schrödinger Equation</h3>

  <p>The (time-independent) Schrödinger Equation has the form:</p>

  <p><code>-d<sup>2</sup>&#968; / dx<sup>2</sup> + PotentialEnergy * &#968; = TotalEnergy
  * &#968;</code></p>

  <p>Rearranging, we get:</p>

  <p><code>-d<sup>2</sup>&#968; / dx<sup>2</sup> = (TotalEnergy - PotentialEnergy) *
  &#968;</code></p>

  <p>which can be understood as:</p>

  <p><code>-d<sup>2</sup>&#968; / dx<sup>2</sup> = KineticEnergy * &#968;</code></p>

  <p>(Note the KineticEnergy is a function of x). Usually the KineticEnergy is positive.
  Shifting the minus sign to the other side and squinting, we get an equation that is
  sort of like:</p>

  <p><code>d<sup>2</sup>&#968; / dx<sup>2</sup> = SomethingNegative * &#968;</code></p>

  <p>The solution is a complex exponential: sines and cosines. So in this regime of
  positive kinetic energy, &#968; is an oscillating sinusoidal.</p>

  <p>But what if the kinetic energy is negative? Then we get an equation that looks
  like:</p>

  <p><code>d<sup>2</sup>&#968; / dx<sup>2</sup> = SomethingPositive * &#968;</code></p>

  <p>The solution is a <i>real</i> exponential (hyperbolic sine/cosine). This means we
  either exponentially blow-up (e<sup>x</sup>) or exponentially decay (e<sup>-x</sup>).
  The blow-up is non-localized, which is unphysical, so the only physical possibility is
  exponential decay.</p>

  <p>(What if the kinetic energy is <i>zero</i>? Then we get that &#968; is a line. A
  line can only go to zero at infinity if it is already everywhere zero, i.e. no particle
  at all.)</p>

  <p>Note that this notion of "negative kinetic energy" is really a mathematical trick.
  You can measure the position of a particle, and compute what a classical particle's
  kinetic energy "would have to be" at that point. However it's a mistake to say that the
  particle has a negative kinetic energy; because of the uncertainty principle we can't
  say what its energy precisely is at all. Indeed, if you measure the kinetic energy
  directly, you will never see a negative value (exercise for the reader: prove
  this!)</p>

  <p>So to summarize, the Schrödinger Equation for physical states has two
  modes: oscillating and exponential decay, which correspond to the classically allowed
  and forbidden regions respectively. The classical turning points represent switching
  between the two modes. Thus the turning points are a natural place to join our two
  wavefunctions.</p>

  <p>This change in the first derivative is visible as a kink in the wavefunction. It's
  only at very special energies that the first derivatives happen to match and the kink
  disappears. These are the eigenenergies, and this illustrates how quantization of
  energy arises.</p>

  <h3>Starting Points</h3>

  <p>There is a second wrinkle: the Numerov method requires TWO initial points to get it
  started. (Indeed, it would be surprising if it did not: the Schrödinger
  equation is second-order, so we need two boundary conditions.) These points are next to
  each other: think &#968;(x) and &#968;(x + dx).</p>

  <p>Here we leverage the fact that we can multiply a wavefunction by any nonzero complex
  number, and we get a physically-identical new solution. This means that the actual
  starting value of the wavefunction hardly matters: we're just going to scale it
  anyways! All that matters is whether it's zero or nonzero.</p>

  <p>So there are only two interesting cases: either exactly one of &#968;(x) and
  &#968;(x+dx) are zero, or neither of them is zero. (If both are zero, we get the
  trivial solution &#968; = 0). Furthermore, if one is zero, it doesn't matter which one
  (by continuity the solutions must be very close to each other). So either &#968;(x) is
  zero, and &#968;(x) is nonzero. Note that if our potential is symmetric, and we let our
  starting x be its minimum, these solutions correspond to odd and even
  wavefunctions.</p>

  <p>So for any given energy, we have two solutions, corresponding conceptually to odd
  and even wavefunctions. We can mix (linearly combine) these two solutions however we
  like to get a new wavefunction with that energy. In particular, we can combine them so
  that one of the kinks cancels out! That is, we choose a linear sum that zeros out the
  discontinuity in the first derivative, on the left side. If this happens to cancels out
  the right-side kink too, we have found an eigenenergy, and our solution is
  physical.</p>

  <p>This has the compelling visual effect of making the wavefunction appear to "extrude"
  from the right side as the energy increases. This is evocative, but not physically
  meaningful: only the energy eigenvalues are allowed.</p>
